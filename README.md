🛡️ Why MIT?
I chose the MIT License because it reflects my goal with this portfolio: to share code freely and professionally.

This project is intended to be a transparent example of my skills, structure, and design thinking.  
I’m happy if others learn from it or even reuse parts of it without worrying about legal complexity.

MIT allows open collaboration without forcing others to open-source their own work in return.  
It keeps things flexible and frictionless, just like good software should be.
